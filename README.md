# Agile Software Development Camp (ASD-200-CMP)
## Java Cucumber Example using Gradle
All build and test commands can be run using the Makefile. For instance "make test" will run all unit tests. "make verify" will run all Cucumber tests.  

This example has a shell implementation for the case study, with one simple scenario implemented with failing acceptance tests. The output of these tests, with an example if living documentation and images, is exported to the output folder and published to GitHub pages on push to the develop branch.
